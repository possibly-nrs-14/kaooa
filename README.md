On running the file, a start-up screen is displayed, with a "play" button below the title of the game. On clicking this button, the main game window will be displayed.

The main window consists of 10 cyan circles connected by lines to form a star. As per the game "kaooa", crows play first. Crows are denoted by the color black whereas the vulture is denoted by the color white. On clicking on an empty (cyan) circle, it will turn black or white, depending on whether a crow or vulture is to be moved there. 

When the vulture starts capturing crows, the number of crows captured so far will be displayed, and when either the crows or the vulture win the game, a message will be displayed. 

Important note: Until all 7 crows have been placed on the board, during the crows' turn, only new crows can be placed. Once all 7 crows have been placed on the board, **click on the crow to be moved before clicking on where it is to be moved.** In case of multiple such clicks, the crow that will be moved is the **last clicked crow.**
